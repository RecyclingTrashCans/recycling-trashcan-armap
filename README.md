# ARCore Geospatial Codelab project

This is an Android App based on the new Google Geospatial API.
Basically we take advantage of the fact that the Fresno State campus has full Street View coverage.
Street View contains information to recognize buildings and 
The app's source code is forked off of the [ARCore Geospatial API Codelab](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial/java/codelab#0).


This repository contains the following branches:

* `main`, the starting point of the Codelab;
* `step-position-user`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 3: Determine the user's position](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial/java/codelab#2);
* `step-place-anchor`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 4: Place an anchor using Earth coordinates](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial/java/codelab#2).

If you get stuck at any point in the Codelab, use `git checkout step-position-user` or `git checkout step-place-anchor` to check out the correct code so you can move on.
